# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with design, testing, and maintenance of software application

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

The difference between software engineering and SDLc is that Software engineering involves a more structured and organized software developement process that includes requirements engineering, disgn , coding, testing, and maintenance. In contrast software developement may be a less structured process that involves writting, code, testing and deploying the software

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.


The software Development have 7 phases
1-PLANNING: In tjis phase the project leads to difining the project's purpose and the desired result.

2-REQUIREMENT: Here the project lead analyzes the product or client's goals and decides on the features to aim for as a final goal.

3-DESGN AND PROTOTYPE: The design phase difenes how a software application wiil work. During this phase, teams decide on the programing language, screen layouts, and relevant documentation they will use

4-SOFWARE DEVELOPEMENT: During this phase, developers start programing

5-TESTING: During this phase, different types of testing occur, such as code quality, unit testing, integration testing, performance testing and security testing

6-DEPLOYEMENT: During this phase , the tech suppeot team looks for user feedback and ensures it reaches the dev team

7-MAINTENANCE: yet this last part es still important because bugs or errors missed during tseting are bound to appear.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?


The Waterfall project management method is a lenear step-by-step approach that is ideal for projects with a clear scope and predictable time-lin. In contrast Agile projest management  is a flexible and iterative approach tat enables teams to quickly adapt to changing

The keys difference between the both are :
1-ROLES: Waterfall strictly assign roles to project team memebers, with specific duties. In contrast the agile model empowers team memebers to collaborate.

2-Planning: In waterfall planning is a lenear process done at the beginning of the project, with all requirement and objectives. In contrast agile planning in continous process throughout the project's life cycle.

3-Scope:The waterfall methodology generaly discourage changes to the project's scope. On the orther hand agile is more adaptable to change in scope.

4- TIME FRAMES: The waterfall method is design for  long term-term. Agile however uses short iterations to deliver value rapidly.

5-SPEED: Waterfall projects tend to take longer because all requirements must be agreed  upon before developement can begin. Agile projects, on the other hand are usually delivered more rapidly than waterfall projects due to the iterative development.

6- DELIVERY:Agile allows for quick delivery of projects with shorter lifecyles .Waterfall requires the completion of all tasks before any work can be released

7-FLEXIBILITY: Agile encourages team to respond quickly and adaptively to change during the development process. Waterfall is less flexible and resitant to change once the project's scope has been dfined.

8-TESTING: testing is essential to the agile and waterfall.

9-DOCUMENTATION: Agile relies on minimal documentation, focusing on self-organizing teams and collaboration. Waterfall in contrast, relies heavily  on documentatingeach step in detail

10-COMMUNICATION: Agile emphasizes informal communicatio in waterfall communication is more formal.

Agile is preferred when the end goal maybe unclear or difficul to define. And waterfall works well when the customer's demands are precise and when the are ne significant changes.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the area of systems engineering that  deals with the process of developing and verifying the systeme. Following good requirement engineering practices helps achieve the primary objective of making sure that the delivered system meets the customer's.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

In software enginering modularity is a fundamental design principe aimed at creating software in a way tha minimizes depencies among the components of a system.
Modularity greatly enhances scalability by breaking down the software modules, we can more easily adapt, extend or replace the system witout affecting orthers.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?


-Unit testing: Is the process where we test the smallest functional unit code
-Integration testing: It tests the small module or a piece of code of an application or a product.
-System testing: Testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements
-Acceptance testing:Is the testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements.

Testing is crucial in software development because it helps to insure quality code
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems is the pratice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems is important in software because it have some tools that helps software teams manage change to source code over time.
Example of version control systems 'GIT'
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
The responsabilities faced in managing software projects are:
-Solve issues that arise
-Manage the money
-Create and lead your dream team
-Monitor Project prgress and set Deadlines

The challenges faced in managing software are:
-unclear and undefined expectations
-time constraint
-poor communication
-skills management
-Changing technologies

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs.

The different type of maintenace activities are:
-Preventive maintenance: Is aimed at catching and fixing problms before they happen
-Condition-based maintenance: Is sometimes considered to be a more advanced alternative to preventive maintenace
-Predictive-maintenance: Refers to a specific type condition-based maintenance in which systems are constanly observed via sensor devices
-Corrective maintenance: Is initiated when a problem is discovered while working on another work order. With corrective maintenance issues are caught just in time
-Predetermined maintenance: Is carried out using rules and suggestions created by the original manufacture.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Some ethical issues that software engineers might face are:
-Weak security
-Wrong Priotities
-Unethical data collection. With the shift to digital marketing, companies are exponentially valuing user data

Software engineers should strive to minimize harm caused by thier actions or the softwarethey create .
Be honest and trustworthy. Honesty is a fundamentale aspect of ethics.
